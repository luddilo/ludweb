        <b>What?</b> A 1on1 session where we practise contact improvisation
        ("CI"). Just like in a normal CI Jam, we improvise, but my intention is
        to focus on your expansion. I am the canvas, you are the main act. I am
        the baseline and you the guitar solo. I hold space, and what comes up
        comes up. Just like CI, this is strictly platonic - the only difference
        is that the space is private. You are welcome to film the dance if you
        want. The sessions are 1-2h long. Donation based.

          Thanks for the precious dance Ludwig! I don't remember a contact dance
          with a tall person like you which felt so light, fluid and careful.
          Words can only narrow it down, but definitely a very pleasant dance
          and deep tissue massage all in one üôè - Maike

        <b>Why?</b> Even before my CI obsession, I have long known that I have a
        strong presence and powerful touch. I have wanted to start giving
        body-work sessions and tried different types of massage modalities but
        never found anything that has felt "me" until I found CI. I think that
        my combination of being large but still very sensitive allows me to both
        deeply listen to and follow as well as amplify or direct your movements.
        You are much welcome to join me in a public jam if you are not ready to
        book a session.
