        I have always been dancing, but only recently (fall 2023) did I fall
        headlessly in love with contact improvisation. Before that, I knew I
        loved contact impro, but it was something that I occasionally was lucky
        to do at an ecstatic dance or at a party. In 2023, I realized that there
        are people equally (well.. equally is a strong word in this case)
        obsessed with the practise, and frequent jams where people go to do
        exactly this.

        days, most of which was dancing contact. Since then, I have danced
        almost every day. I have chased contact from Barcelona to Alvarve,
        Lisbon, Berlin and finally back to Barcelona where I am now jamming few
        times per week and also have a small dance space in my apartment in
        Gracia.

        I am not sure how dancing will come to shape my life, but never have I
        felt a calling stronger than this.{" "}
